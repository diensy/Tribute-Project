          <h2>The Father Of India</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Monhandas Karamchand Gandhi</b> was born in the small town of
            Porbandar, on the west coast of India, on October 2 1869. He
            belonged by birth to the Vaishya, or trading caste. His father died
            when he was 15 years old, and apart from that time, his mother
            became the greatest influence in his life. Her spiritual teacher was
            a Jain devotee. Among the Jains in India the central doctrine is the
            "sanctity of all life," or Ahimsa, which is often translated as
            "non-violence." This teaching remained paramount with Gandhi. In
            South Africa When 19, he came to London, qualified as a barrister
            (being "called" at the Inner Temple), and, returning to Bombay in
            1892, set up a practice. In 1896 he went to the Transvaal to help a
            client in a legal suit. That visit changed the whole course of his
            life. Seeing the social and political disabilities of his
            fellow-countrymen in South Africa, he decided to stay and help them
            and soon he had become their political leader and adviser. Meanwhile
            a religious conflict was taking place in within him. He read Tolstoy
            and corresponded with him: the result was an experiment in the
            simple communal life conducted by a small band of enthusiasts whom
            he had gathered together. He became an ascetic of the most rigorous
            type, setting great store by fasting and every form of self-denial.
            To the end of his life he remained a devout Hindu, but declared if
            ever "untouchability" were made part of Hinduism he would cease to
            be a Hindu. Perhaps the greatest religious effort of his life was to
            break down "untouchability."
